## Projects

### **Project 1**

Implements **linear regression**, **second-order polynomial**, and **sixth-order polynomial** models.
Includes an **MSE vs degree** comparison and **logistic regression** (linear and quadratic) for classification.

### **Project 2**

Implements a **single-layer perceptron** for detecting digits (0, 1, 2, 8) and extends it to a **two-layer perceptron** using **backpropagation**.
